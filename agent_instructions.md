# MCP tool interface

## Available tools

- `run_tests_json(pytest_args?: string[]) -> PytestJson`: runs pytest and returns the JSON report body.
- `run_tests_focus(keyword: string) -> PytestJson`: focused run, equivalent to `pytest -k <keyword>`.
- `dap_launch(program: string, cwd?: string, breakpoints?: number[], breakpoints_by_source?: Dict[str, List[int]], stop_on_entry?: boolean, console?: string, wait_for_breakpoint?: boolean, breakpoint_timeout?: number)` -> orchestrated launch via `debugpy.adapter` (returns initialize/configuration/launch responses and optional stopped event). Use `breakpoints_by_source` to set breakpoints in imported modules or additional source files. **Use this for ALL debugging scenarios including web servers, long-running processes, and scripts.**
- `dap_set_breakpoints(source_path: string, lines: number[])` -> resilient setBreakpoints (waits for late `initialized` when needed).
- `dap_list_breakpoints()` -> returns the cached breakpoint map so you can confirm what has been registered.

Note: The server retries breakpoint registration after the debug adapter sends `initialized`. This retry applies both to main-program breakpoints and entries provided via `breakpoints_by_source`. A further retry pass occurs after the first `stopped` event to catch imported-module timing races.

- `dap_continue(thread_id?: number)` -> continues execution (auto-selects first thread if omitted).
- `dap_step_over(thread_id?: number)` / `dap_step_in(thread_id?: number)` / `dap_step_out(thread_id?: number)` -> step controls that reuse the last stopped thread by default.
- `dap_locals()` -> threads, stackTrace, scopes and variables for the current top frame.
- `dap_last_stopped_event()` -> most recent halted event plus cached breakpoints, useful for resuming context in later turns.
- `dap_wait_for_event(name: string, timeout?: number)` -> waits for a specific adapter event (`stopped`, `terminated`, etc.).
- `dap_shutdown()` -> terminates the running adapter session.
- `ensure_demo_program(directory?: string)` -> creates a demo script and returns launch-ready input (program path, cwd, suggested breakpoints).
- `read_text_file(path: string, max_bytes?: number)` -> fetch the contents of a UTF-8 text file so you can inspect code before debugging.

**Transport:** stdio. Use `python scripts/configure_mcp_clients.py` to have the repo update VS Code settings (add/update/remove) and generate a Claude Desktop snippet. Once configured, your MCP client launches `python src/mcp_server.py` automatically.

**Path handling:** `dap_launch` accepts either absolute paths or paths relative to the working directory you provide. If the directory is missing, the server attempts to create it. When the target script is absent, the response includes hintsâ€”use the existing sample apps or call `ensure_demo_program(directory=...)` to scaffold one.

**Key workflow reminder:** Start new debugging sessions with a single `dap_launch` call that includes your breakpoint list. The launch helper performs `initialize`, registers breakpoints, issues `configurationDone`, and starts the target. You do **not** need to call `dap_set_breakpoints` beforehand unless you are adjusting breakpoints mid-session.

**Breakpoints in imported modules:** Use the `breakpoints_by_source` parameter to set breakpoints in any source file, not just the main program. This is essential for debugging multi-file applications and imported modules. Relative paths are resolved from `PROJECT_ROOT` first, then from `cwd` if provided. The tool implements a three-phase retry strategy to ensure breakpoints are registered even if modules aren't loaded yet when the adapter starts.

## Debugging Web Applications (Flask, Django, FastAPI)

**Use `dap_launch` for web applications!** The debugger controls the application lifecycle and allows you to set breakpoints that trigger on HTTP requests.

### Steps

1. **Launch the web app under debugger control:**

   ```json
   {
      "name": "dap_launch",
      "input": {
         "program": "run_flask.py",
         "cwd": ".",
         "breakpoints_by_source": {
            "examples/web_flask/inventory.py": [18]
         },
         "wait_for_breakpoint": false
      }
   }
   ```

2. **Trigger breakpoints via HTTP requests:**

   ```bash
   curl http://127.0.0.1:5001/total
   ```

3. **Wait for stopped event:**

   ```json
   { "name": "dap_wait_for_event", "input": { "name": "stopped", "timeout": 10 } }
   ```

4. **Inspect variables and debug:**

   ```json
   { "name": "dap_locals" }
   { "name": "dap_step_over" }
   { "name": "dap_continue" }
   ```

5. **Clean up:**

   ```json
   { "name": "dap_shutdown" }
   ```

**Important:** Create a launcher script (like `run_flask.py`) that imports your web app as a module to avoid relative import issues. Example:

```python
from examples.web_flask import app
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.main()
```

**Why not dap_attach?** The `dap_attach` approach was investigated but does not work with debugpy. When you run `python -m debugpy --listen`, debugpy does not respond to DAP attach requests. Use `dap_launch` for all debugging scenarios.

## Example workflow for scripts

1. Configure your MCP client (VS Code, Claude Desktop, etc.) so it references `.venv/bin/python src/mcp_server.py`.
2. Launch the debugger session:

    ```json
    {
       "name": "dap_launch",
       "input": {
          "program": "examples/demo_program/demo_program.py",
          "cwd": "examples/demo_program",
          "breakpoints": [14, 20],
          "wait_for_breakpoint": true
       }
    }
    ```

3. On `stoppedEvent`, inspect state:

   ```json
   { "name": "dap_locals" }
   ```

4. Optional: step or inspect additional context

   ```json
   { "name": "dap_step_over" }
   { "name": "dap_last_stopped_event" }
   { "name": "dap_list_breakpoints" }
   ```

5. Resume execution:

   ```json
   { "name": "dap_continue" }
   ```

6. Tear down the adapter:

   ```json
   { "name": "dap_shutdown" }
   ```

7. At any point, run tests with `{ "name": "run_tests_json" }` or `{ "name": "run_tests_focus", "input": { "keyword": "..." } }`.

---

If you need a fresh demo script, call `{ "name": "ensure_demo_program", "input": { "directory": "/tmp/debug_demo" } }` (or omit `directory` to use the default location) before launching the debugger. The response includes `launchInput` you can pass straight to `dap_launch`. Use `{ "name": "read_text_file", "input": { "path": "/tmp/debug_demo/demo_program.py" } }` if you want to review the script first.

*Note:* The stdio client prints incoming events as `[dap:event] ...` for debugging. Feel free to keep or remove these prints in `src/dap_stdio_client.py` depending on your logging needs.
