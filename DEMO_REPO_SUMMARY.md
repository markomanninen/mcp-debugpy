# mcp-debugpy Demo Repository Summary

## Overview

A complete demonstration repository has been created to showcase the mcp-debugpy library. This repository is ready to be pushed to GitHub and serves as a practical example of debugging Python applications using AI agents through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

**Repository Location**: `/tmp/mcp-debugpy-demo`

**GitHub URL** (to be created): `https://github.com/markomanninen/mcp-debugpy-demo`

## What Was Created

### 1. Main Application: Shopping Cart with Bug

**File**: `shopping_cart.py` (93 lines)

A shopping cart application with an intentional bug in the discount calculation. The bug is subtle but produces obvious wrong results:

- **Bug Location**: Line 45
- **Bug Type**: Uses multiplication instead of subtraction for discount
- **Impact**: 10% discount on $1,139.96 gives $129,950.88 instead of $1,025.96

**Features**:

- Clean, well-documented code
- Input validation
- Type hints
- Realistic business logic
- Demo function showing the bug

### 2. Comprehensive Test Suite

**File**: `test_shopping_cart.py` (108 lines)

- **Total Tests**: 10
- **Passing**: 7 (basic functionality)
- **Failing**: 3 (exposing the discount bug)

The failing tests clearly show:

1. Wrong totals even without discount
2. Wrong totals with discount applied
3. Complex scenario completely off

### 3. Documentation

- Shows the bug immediately
- Quick debugging paths
- Spoiler alert section with the fix

#### c. IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md (193 lines)

- Technical design decisions
- Bug analysis and rationale
- Test coverage breakdown
- Debugging strategy guide
- Future enhancement ideas

### 4. Setup and Configuration

#### a. setup.sh (30 lines)

- Automated installation script
- Creates virtual environment
- Installs all dependencies
- Clear status messages
- Cross-platform compatible

#### b. requirements.txt

- Pytest for testing
- Instructions for installing mcp-debugpy from GitHub

- Ready for open source distribution

### 5. Git Repository

**Status**: Initialized with commits

- Initial commit: All main files
- Second commit: Implementation notes

**Branches**:

- `main` (default)

**Ready to push**: Yes, needs remote repository creation

## Installation Verification

The mcp-debugpy package itself was verified and fixed:

### Changes to Main Project

**File**: `pyproject.toml`

Added this line to properly package standalone modules:

```toml
[tool.setuptools]
py-modules = ["cli", "mcp_server", "dap_stdio_client", "dap_stdio_direct", "debug_utils"]
```

**File**: `MANIFEST.in` (created)

Ensures all necessary files are included in the distribution package.

**Result**: Package now builds correctly with all required modules:

- `cli.py` - Command-line interface
- `mcp_server.py` - MCP server implementation
- `dap_stdio_client.py` - Debug Adapter Protocol client
- `dap_stdio_direct.py` - Direct adapter interface
- `debug_utils.py` - Utility functions

### Package Build Verification

```bash
python -m build  # ✓ Successfully built
dist/mcp_debugpy-0.2.0-py3-none-any.whl  # ✓ Contains all modules
dist/mcp_debugpy-0.2.0.tar.gz  # ✓ Contains all source files
```

## Demo Repository Testing

All components were tested:

### 1. Application Test

```bash
python shopping_cart.py
# ✓ Runs successfully
# ✓ Shows the bug (wrong total)
# ✓ Displays warning message
```

### 2. Test Suite Test

```bash
pytest test_shopping_cart.py -v
# ✓ 10 tests collected
# ✓ 7 tests pass
# ✓ 3 tests fail (as expected)
# ✓ Clear failure messages
```

### 3. Git Status

```bash
git log --oneline
# ✓ 2 commits created
# ✓ All files tracked
# ✓ Clean working directory
```

## Next Steps to Publish

### 1. Main mcp-debugpy Repository

**Current state**:

- Package builds correctly
- All modules included
- Ready for PyPI publication

**To publish to PyPI**:

```bash
# From mvp-agent-debug directory
python -m build
python -m twine upload dist/mcp_debugpy-0.2.0*
```

**Or publish to test PyPI first**:

```bash
python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/mcp_debugpy-0.2.0*
```

### 2. Demo Repository

**Step 1**: Create GitHub repository

```bash
# Via GitHub web interface
# Name: mcp-debugpy-demo
# Description: Demo of debugging Python apps with AI using mcp-debugpy
# Public repository
# Don't initialize with README (we have one)
```

**Step 2**: Push to GitHub

```bash
cd /tmp/mcp-debugpy-demo
git remote add origin https://github.com/markomanninen/mcp-debugpy-demo.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Step 3**: Configure repository

- Add topics: `mcp`, `debugpy`, `python`, `debugging`, `ai-tools`, `demo`
- Enable Issues
- Enable Discussions (optional)
- Add repository description
- Set homepage URL (link to mcp-debugpy main repo)

**Step 4**: Update main mcp-debugpy README
Add a section linking to the demo:

```markdown
## Demo Repository

3. **AI-assisted debugging** - Natural language debugging sessions
4. **Test-driven debugging** - Using tests to guide debugging
5. **Python best practices** - Type hints, validation, documentation

## Files Ready for Commit to Main Repo

These changes should be committed to the main mcp-debugpy repository:

1. **pyproject.toml** - Updated with py-modules
2. **MANIFEST.in** - New file for package inclusion
3. **dist/** - New builds (can be generated on demand)

**Suggested commit message**:

```
fix: Add standalone modules to package distribution

Previously, core modules (cli.py, mcp_server.py, etc.) were not included
in the built package because setuptools.packages.find only finds packages
(directories with __init__.py).

Changes:
- Add py-modules to [tool.setuptools] in pyproject.toml
- Create MANIFEST.in to explicitly include all necessary files
- Verify build includes all required modules

This makes the package installable via pip and usable as a module.

Tested with: python -m build && unzip -l dist/*.whl
```

## Documentation Updates Needed

### Main README.md

Add a "Demo Repository" section:

```markdown
